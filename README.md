# font-changer
Chrome/Chromium Extension for changing the fonts of websites.

Most websites should work out of the box. There are some checks that should catch most of icon elements and such so we don't change the font there to not break anything.

Generally supported is:
- Most common websites and web tags
  - &#x3C;div&#x3E;, &#x3C;span&#x3E;, &#x3C;a&#x3E;, &#x3C;p&#x3E;, all &#x3C;h&#x3E; tags, &#x3C;q&#x3E;, &#x3C;pre>&#x3E;, &#x3C;code&#x3E;, &#x3C;blockquote&#x3E;, &#x3C;cite&#x3E;, common stylings for italic, bold, subscript...
- Specially added YouTube Strings and regularly formated (bold, italic,...) YouTube Strings
- Keeping state of chosen option
- Use of system installed fonts
